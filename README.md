𝗠𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗔𝗰𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗺𝗶𝗰 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀:
Computer Organization:
 • Developed an Assembler in C language.
 • Built a Simulator to verify the Assembler’s correctness.
 • wrote test programs in Assembly language.

VLSI: Designed and implemented a 4-bit ALU processor using Cadence Virtuoso.

Advanced VLSI:
 • Verification - Developed System Verilog and TCL scripts for functional verification of 
 hardware designs.
 • physical design - Performed physical design tasks using Fusion Compiler (Synopsys).

Final Project: Combined Source/Channel Coding for Hyperspectral Sensing (Implemented in Python)
 • Developed Python code for hyperspectral image compression for a small satellite being developed by 
 Tel Aviv University for climate and environmental research.
 • wrote error correction code that reduces noise in the transmission channel from the satellite to the 
 ground station. 
 • The code has successfully passed tests using remote sensing satellite databases and is in advanced 
 stages, which may lead to future implementation on actual satellites.
 • 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀: Python, Hyperspectral image compression, Error Correcting Codes
