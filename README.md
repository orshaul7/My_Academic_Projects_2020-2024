### Main Academic Projects:
**Computer Organization:**
- Developed an Assembler in C language.
- Built a Simulator to verify the Assemblerâ€™s correctness.
- Wrote test programs in Assembly language.

**VLSI:**
- Designed and implemented a 4-bit ALU processor using Cadence Virtuoso.

**Advanced VLSI:**
- **Verification:** Developed System Verilog and TCL scripts for functional verification of hardware designs.
- **Physical Design:** Performed physical design tasks using Fusion Compiler (Synopsys).

**Final Project: Combined Source/Channel Coding for Hyperspectral Sensing (Implemented in Python):**
- Developed Python code for hyperspectral image compression for a small satellite being developed by Tel Aviv University for climate and environmental research.
- Wrote error correction code that reduces noise in the transmission channel from the satellite to the ground station.
- The code has successfully passed tests using remote sensing satellite databases and is in advanced stages, which may lead to future implementation on actual satellites.

**Skills:** Python, Hyperspectral image compression, Error Correcting Codes
